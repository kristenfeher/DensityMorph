Description: This is a package for exploratory data analysis and visualisation of a large number of single cell datasets.
    It uses a novel quasi-distance to embed single cell datasets in a latent space. 
    For more details, see the manuscript 'Comparing single cell datasets using DensityMorph' by Kristen Feher. 
    This package currently has limited functionality, I hope to extend it in the future.
